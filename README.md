# CodeIgniter-MY_Model

This **CodeIgniter MY_Model** is the result of a lengthy tutorial about constructing a **MY_Model** in CodeIgniter (http://avenir.ro/revisiting-my_model-copying-jamie-rumbelow-looking-eloquent/). It's based on **Jamie Rumbelow's Base Model** (https://github.com/jamierumbelow/codeigniter-base-model), but with some changed/added methods. It provides a full CRUD base for database interactions, as well as an event-based observer system, intelligent table name guessing and soft delete.

**VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: MY_Model DOESN'T REPLACE THE QUERY BUILDER. IF YOU HAVE A VERY COMPLEX QUERY, DO NOT ASK MY_Model TO DO IT FOR YOU**

## Synopsis
```php
class User_model extends MY_Model { }

$this->load->model('user_model');

$this->user_model->get(1)

$this->user_model->get_all();

$this->user_model->where('username','avenirer')->get();

$this->user_model->insert(array('username' => 'avenirer','email' => 'avenir.ro@gmail.com'));

$this->user_model->update(array('status' => '0'), 1);

$this->user_model->delete(1);
```

## Installation/Usage

Download and drag the **MY_Model.php** file into your **application/core** directory. CodeIgniter will load and initialise this class automatically.

Extend your model classes from MY_Model and all the functionality will be baked in automatically.
```php
class User_model extends MY_Model
{
	public $table = 'users'; // you MUST mention the table name
	public $primary_key = 'id'; // you MUST mention the primary key
	public $fillable = array(); // If you want, you can set an array with the fields that can be filled by insert/update
	public $protected = array(); // ...Or you can set an array with the fields that cannot be filled by insert/update
	public function __construct()
	{
		parent::__construct();
	}
}
```
If extended like that, MY_Model makes the following assumptions:

* there are **at least a "created_at" and "updated_at" columns**.
wh
If you want, you can be original by changing the settings before the `parent::__construct();`
```php
class User_model extends MY_Model
{
	public function __construct()
	{

		// you can set the database connection that you want to use for this particular model, by passing the group connection name or a config array. By default will use the default connection
		$this->_database_connection  = 'special_connection';

		// you can disable the use of timestamps. This way, MY_Model won't try to set a created_at and updated_at value on create methods. Also, if you pass it an array as calue, it tells MY_Model, that the first element is a created_at field type, the second element is a updated_at field type (and the third element is a deleted_at field type if $this->soft_deletes is set to TRUE)
		$this->timestamps = TRUE

		// you can enable (TRUE) or disable (FALSE) the "soft delete" on records. Default is FALSE, which means that when you delete a row, that one is gone forever
        	$this->soft_deletes = FALSE

        	// you can set how the model returns you the result: as 'array' or as 'object'. the default value is 'object'
		$this->return_as = 'object' | 'array'

		// you can set relationships between tables

		//$this->has_one['...'] allows establishing ONE TO ONE or more ONE TO ONE relationship(s) between models/tables
		$this->has_one['phone'] = 'Phone_model';
		// or $this->has_one['phone'] = array('Phone_model','foreign_key','local_key');
		$this->has_one['address'] = 'Address_model';
		// or $this->has_one['address'] = array('Address_model','foreign_key','another_local_key');

		// $this->has_many[''...] allows establishing ONE TO MANY or more ONE TO MANY relationship(s) between models/tables
		$this->has_many['posts'] = 'Post_model';
		// or $this->has_many['posts'] = array('Posts_model','foreign_key','another_local_key');

		// $this->has_many_pivot['...'] allows establishing MANY TO MANY or more MANY TO MANY relationship(s) between models/tables with the use of a PIVOT TABLE
		$this->has_many_pivot['posts'] = 'Post_model';
		// or $this->has_many_pivot['posts'] = array('Posts_model','foreign_primary_key','local_primary_key');

		// ATTENTION! The pivot table name must be composed of the two table names separated by "_" the table names having to to be alphabetically ordered (NOT users_posts, but posts_users).
		// Also the pivot table must contain as identifying columns the columns named by convention as follows: table_name_singular + _ + foreign_table_primary_key.
		// For example: considering that a post can have multiple authors, a pivot table that connects two tables (users and posts) must be named posts_users and must have post_id and user_id as identifying columns for the posts.id and users.id tables.

		// you can also use caching. If you want to use the set_cache('...') method, but you want to change the way the caching is made you can use the following properties:

		$this->cache_driver = 'file';
		//By default, MY_Model uses the files (CodeIgniter's file driver) to cache result. If you want to change the way it stores the cache, you can change the $cache_driver property to whatever CodeIgniter cache driver you want to use.

		$this->cache_prefix = 'mm';
		//With $cache_prefix, you can prefix the name of the caches. By default any cache made by MY_Model starts with 'mm' + _ + "name chosen for cache"

		parent::__construct();
 	}
}
```

## CREATE

### Inserting values

You can insert values by using the **insert()** method, passing it an array or an object as parameter. You can also insert multiple rows of data by using a multidimensional array.

```php
<?php
$insert_data = array('username'=>'avenirer','email'=>'email@email.com');
$this->load->model('user_model');
$this->user_model->insert($insert_data);
?>
```

### Inserting directly from forms with form validation

You can at any time directly insert values from forms into the tables using the **from_form()** method. First of all **make sure you have a fillable or a protected property (at least the primary key should be in there)**, because you must make sure no-one interferes with your id's or whatever you use to uniquely identify the rows. Also is worth noting that, because the inserts and updates from forms are done directly without intervention from developer, **YOU MUST DEFINE VALIDATION RULES FOR ALL FIELDS THAT YOU ARE FILLING**

After you've done this, you must set the rules. If you use the MY_Model's form validation, I advise you to write the rules inside your model. Below you can find an example of model:

```php
<?php

defined('BASEPATH') OR exit('No direct script access allowed');

class User_model extends MY_Model
{
    //public $soft_deletes = TRUE;
    public $has_one = array('phone' => 'Phone_model', 'address' => array('Address_model','user_id','id'));
    public $has_many_pivot = array('posts' => array('Post_model','id','user_id'));
    public $timestamps = FALSE;
	public $protected = array('id');

    function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct();
    }

    public $rules = array(
            'insert' => array(
                    
                    'username' => array(
                            'field'=>'username',
                            'label'=>'Username',
                            'rules'=>'trim|required'),
                            
                    'email' => array(
                            'field'=>'email',
                            'label'=>'Email',
                            'rules'=>'trim|valid_email|required',
                            'errors' => array ('required' => 'Error Message rule "required" for field email',
                                    'trim' = > 'Error message for rule "trim" for field email',
                                    'valid_email' = > 'Error message for rule "valid_email" for field email')
                    ),
            'update' => array(
                    'username' => array(
                            'field'=>'username',
                            'label'=>'Username',
                            'rules'=>'trim|required'),
                            
                    'email' => array(
                            'field'=>'email',
                            'label'=>'Email',
                            'rules'=>'trim|valid_email|required',
                            'errors' => array ('required' => 'Error Message rule "required" for field email',
                                    'trim' = > 'Error message for rule "trim" for field email',
                                    'valid_email' = > 'Error message for rule "valid_email" for field email')
                    ),
                    'id' => array(
                            'field'=>'id',
                            'label'=>'ID',
                            'rules'=>'trim|is_natural_no_zero|required'),
            )                    
    );
}
```

After setting the model this way, you are ready to go. So, in your controller you can go like this:

```php
public function add_user()
{
	$this->load->model('user_model');
	$id = $this->user_model->from_form()->insert();
	if($id === FALSE)
	{
		$this->load->view('user_form_view');
	}
	else
	{
		echo  $id;
		//...whatever you want to do. the form was submitted and the data was inserted
	}
}
```

If you have any doubts, this is how the view looks:

```php
<?php

echo form_open();
echo form_label('Username','username').':<br />';
echo form_error('username');
echo form_input('username',set_value('username')).'<br />';

echo form_label('Email','email').':<br />';
echo form_error('email');
echo form_input('email',set_value('email'));

echo form_submit('submit','Save user');
echo form_close();
```

You can add additional values into database, values that are not taken from the form fields, by adding a second paramenter to the from_form() method:

```php
<?php
...
$id = $this->user_model->from_form(NULL,array('created_by'=>'1'))->insert();
...
```

## READ

### Arrays vs Objects

By default, MY_Model is setup to return objects. If you'd like to return results as array you can:

* either define `$this->return_as = 'array'` in the constructor
* or add `as_array()` into the query chain:
```php
$users = $this->user_model->as_array()->get_all(); $posts = $this->post_model->as_object()->get_all();
```
If you'd like all your calls to use the array methods, you can set the $return_type variable to array.

### Return as dropdown

There are moments when you need to retrieve data to fill a select input type. For this we have a method called as_dropdown($field). This method will return an array having the primary keys as array keys and a $field as values:
```php
$categories = $this->category_model->as_dropdown('title')->get_all();
echo form_dropdown($categories);
```

### Caching

If you want to cache the result for faster output, you can at any time use the MY_Model's caching. To do this you simply attach a set_cache('name') inside the query chain:

```php
$this->load->model('user_model');
$users = $this->user_model->as_array()->set_cache('get_all_users')->get_all();
```
The code above will create a cache file named mm_users_get_all_users. If you want the cache to have a time limit, you can pass a second parameter that represents the number of seconds:

```php
$users = $this->user_model->as_array()->set_cache('get_all_users',3600)->get_all();
```
This file will then be used by the model whenever you call the get_all() method that has a set_cache('get_all_users') method in the chain.

Whenever you want, you can delete the cache "manually" by using the delete_cache() method.

There are three ways you can delete the cache:

* `delete_cache('get_all_users')` deletes a certain cache;
* `delete_cache('*')` deletes the caches that start with 'mm_users_' (where 'mm_users' is the prefix used by MY_Model in conjuction with your model's table name);
* `delete_cache()` deletes all cache that start with 'mm_' (where 'mm_' is the prefix used by MY_Model).

Example:
```php
$this->user_model->delete_cache('get_all_users');
```

#### Auto-delete caching

You can set the model in a way so that the cache will be deleted automatically whenever you write/update/delete data from your model's table. This way you won't need to do it manually. You can have this enabled by setting the delete_cache_on_save property to TRUE in the constructor:

```php
class User_model extends MY_Model
{
    //public $soft_deletes = TRUE;
    public $delete_cache_on_save = TRUE;

    function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct();
    }
    ...
```

## Pagination

You can at any time "paginate" the results. You can do this by simply changing `get_all()` method with `paginate()` method. The paginate() method can receive up to three parameters:

* first paramater, which is optional (default is set to 10) is the number of rows per page;
* second parameter, which is optional (default is set to NULL), is the total of rows;
* the third parameter, which is also optional (default is set to 1) is the page you want to get.

If you only passed the first parameter, the page number will be retrieved from the URL (the last segment of the page). If you didn't pass the second parameter you will only be able to output the previous and next page, without links to all the pages.

Examples:

```php
$total_posts = $this->post_model->count_rows(); // retrieve the total number of posts
$posts = $this->post_model->paginate(10,$total_posts); // paginate with 10 rows per page
echo $this->post_model->all_pages; // will output links to all pages like this model: "< 1 2 3 4 5 >". It will put a link if the page number is not the "current page"
echo $this->post_model->previous_page; // will output link to the previous page like this model: "<". It will only put a link if there is a "previous page"
echo $this->post_model->next_page; // will output link to the next page like this model: ">". It will only put a link if there is a "next page"
```
Don't you like how the links look? You can change them by modifing the following properties inside the models that extend the MY_Model():

```php
$this->pagination_delimiters = array('<span>','</span>');
$this->pagination_arrows = array('&lt;','&gt;');
```
Also, you can use the set_pagination_delimiters($delimiters) and set_pagination_arrows($arrows) methods, where $delimiters and $arrows are arrays.

## UPDATE
### The update() method

#### The basic update()

The update() method is pretty much the same as the insert() method.

To update some values you must pass an array with the columns as keys and their respective values as values of array. The second parameter can be either the id of the row or the column name used to identify the row:

Update using row id:
```php
<?php
$update_data = array('username'=>'avenirer','email'=>'email@email.com');
$this->load->model('user_model');
$this->user_model->update($update_data,2);
?>
```
Update using column name:
```php
<?php
$update_data = array('username'=>'avenirer','email'=>'email@email.com', 'id'=>'2');
$this->load->model('user_model');
$this->user_model->update($update_data,'email');
?>
```
You can also pass a multidimensional array to change multiple rows. In this case the second parameter should be the name of the identifying column.

#### Update using the where() method

Another method to do an update would be to use the update() method in conjuction with the where() method:
```php
<?php
$update_data = array('username'=>'avenirer','email'=>'email@email.com');
$this->load->model('user_model');
$this->user_model->where('email','email@email.com')->update($update_data);
?>
```

#### Update directly from form using from_form() method

The update can also be made directly from the form with validation, the same way as is done by the insert() method. The only difference would be that you need to specify which input field should be used as reference for the rows to be updated. You do this by passing a third parameter as array:
```php
$this->user_model->from_form(NULL,NULL,array('user_id'))->update(); // where user_id is an input element
```
Also, if you want to reference the field with a direct value that doesn't exist within the form, then you can assign it within the array too.
```php
$this->user_model->from_form(NULL,NULL,array('user_id' => 1))->update(); // where user_id is referenced directly
```
If you need to use another table field that is not in the form, in order to identify the row, you can pass it to the from_form() method as a second parameter:
```php
$id = $this->user_model->from_form(NULL,array('created_by'=>'1'), array('user_id'))->update();
```

#### Update custom string with disabled escaping

You can prevent escaping content by passing an optional third argument, and setting it to FALSE (the second parameter is a where condition set as an array - you can set it to NULL):
```php
$this->user_model->update(array('views'=>'views+1'), array('id'=>'1'), FALSE);
```
**TAKE CARE:** This doesn't work with values that have space inside unless you set quotes on them. So I would rather not use this (Maybe in future I will change the way this works)

## DELETE
### The delete() method

### Soft Deletes

By default, the delete mechanism works with an SQL DELETE statement. However, you might not want to destroy the data, you might instead want to perform a **'soft delete'**.

If you enable soft deleting, the **deleted_at** row will be filled with the current date and time, rather than actually being removed from the database.

You can enable soft delete in the constructor:
```php
$this->soft_deletes = TRUE;
```
Once you've enabled it whenever you do, for example, a `$this->user_model->delete(3);` the **delete()** method will only create a datetime in the **deleted_at** column of the user with id 3.

If you really want to delete a row you can use `force_delete()` method:
```php
$this->user_model->force_delete(6);
```
You can also restore or "un-delete" a row by using the `restore()` method:
```php
$this->user_model->restore(3)
```
This will set to **NULL** the **deleted_at** value.

Once you soft delete a row, that row won't appear in read results unless expressely asked to:

For this, you have the following methods:

* `with_trashed()` - will show all rows, including those that were soft deleted
* `only_trashed()` - will show only the rows that were soft deleted

You can also check if a row is **soft_deleted** by using `trashed()` method:
```php
$this->user_model->trashed(3); // will return TRUE or FALSE
```

### The observers for the delete() method

The before_soft_delete and before_delete observers offer the ID's of the rows that are about to be (soft) deleted. At the end of the callback you should return the array of ID's.

The after_soft_delete and after_delete are also returning the ID's of the rows that you wanted deleted (Not those that have been deleted, so take care...). The one difference is that the array will also contain a key named "affected_rows" that will have the number of affected rows as value.

## Relationships

### Creating relationships

When you extend MY_Model, you can also setup relationships between the model and other models. There are multiple ways of creating relations between tables:

#### The right way

Before `parent::__construct();` you add:

```php
$this->has_one['phone'] = array('foreign_model'=>'Phone_model','foreign_table'=>'phones','foreign_key'=>'user_id','local_key'=>'id');
```

#### The semi-fast way

In the semi-fast way, you can simply pass the model, the foreign key and the local key (mind the order). The table name will be taken from the related model:

```php
$this->has_one['phone'] = array('Phone_model','foreign_key','local_key');
```

#### The fast and dirty way

The fast and dirty way will simply need the related model name. All else will be taken from the model (I wouldn't advise this solution)

```php
$this->has_one['address'] = 'Address_model';
```

### Has One (one to one) relationship (property)

Has One relationship tells our model that ever record in the table has assigned to it a record in another table. It is my opinion that there is no need to do a reverse relation like in Eloquent, where there is a "belongs to" relationship because, the truth be told, being a "one to one" relationship it's an equality between the entities.

We can define a "one to one" relationship by using the has_one property inside the constructor:
```php
class User_model extends MY_Model
{

	function __construct()
	{
		$this->has_one['phone'] = array('foreign_model'=>'Phone_model','foreign_table'=>'phones','foreign_key'=>'user_id','local_key'=>'id');
	}
 }
 ```

The reverse of the relationship is defined taking care of the foreign key and local key:

```php
class Phone_model extends MY_Model
{

	function __construct()
	{
		$this->has_one['user'] = array('foreign_model'=>'User_model','foreign_table'=>'users','foreign_key'=>'id','local_key'=>'user_id');
	}
}
```

###Has Many relationship (property)

Has Many relationship tells our model that a record in the table can have many related records in another table. The reverse of this relationship is a has one relation, which translates into a One To Many type of relationship. For a reverse relationship of type Many To Many, we will have another property named Has Many Pivot.

```php
class User_model extends MY_Model
{

	function __construct()
	{
		$this->has_many['posts'] = array('foreign_model'=>'Post_model','foreign_table'=>'posts','foreign_key'=>'author_id','local_key'=>'id');
	}
 }
 ```

The reverse of the relationship (which in this case is a one to one) is defined the same:

```php
class Post_model extends MY_Model
{

	function __construct()
	{
		$this->has_one['user'] = array('foreign_model'=>'User_model','foreign_table'=>'users','foreign_key'=>'id','local_key'=>'user_id');
	}
}
```

### Has Many Pivot relationship (property)

Many to many relationship can have one to one as reverse relationship. But there are also many to many relationships that have many to many as reverse relationships. For this we have has_many_pivot key as relation. This one allows establishing MANY TO MANY or more MANY TO MANY relationship(s) between models/tables with the use of a PIVOT TABLE.

#### Setting up a Has Many Pivot relationship THE RIGHT WAY

For the MY_Model to work properly every single time, you must provide it every single detail:

```php
class User_model extends MY_Model
{

	function __construct()
	{
		$this->has_many_pivot['posts'] = array(
		    'foreign_model'=>'Post_model',
		    'pivot_table'=>'posts_users',
		    'local_key'=>'id',
		    'pivot_local_key'=>'user_id', /* this is the related key in the pivot table to the local key
		        this is an optional key, but if your column name inside the pivot table
		        doesn't respect the format of "singularlocaltable_primarykey", then you must set it. In the next title
		        you will see how a pivot table should be set, if you want to  skip these keys */
		    'pivot_foreign_key'=>'post_id', /* this is also optional, the same as above, but for foreign table's keys */
		    'foreign_key'=>'id',
		    'get_relate'=>FALSE /* another optional setting, which is explained below */
		);
	}
 }
```

#### Setting up a Has Many Pivot relationship THE FAST AND PRONE TO ERRORS WAY.

**ATTENTION**: The pivot table name must be composed of the two connected table names separated by _ (underscore) the table names having to be alphabetically ordered (NOT users_posts, but posts_users). Also the pivot table must contain as identifying columns the columns named by convention as follows: foreign_table_name_singular + _ (underscore) + foreign_table_primary_key.

For example: considering that a post can have multiple authors, a pivot table that connects the two tables (**users** and **posts**) must be named **posts_users** (**NOT users_posts**) and must have **post_id** and **user_id** as identifying columns for the **posts.id** and **users.id** tables.

Usage example:

```php
class User_model extends MY_Model
{

	function __construct()
	{
		$this->has_many_pivot['posts'] = 'Post_model';
		// or $this->has_many_pivot['posts'] = array('Post_model','id','id'); where the second parameter is the foreign primary key of posts table, and the third parameter is the local primary key.
	}
 }
 ```

The reverse of the relationship (which in this case is also a many to many) is defined the same:

```php
class Post_model extends MY_Model
{

	function __construct()
	{
		$this->has_many_pivot['users'] = 'User_model';
		// or $this->has_many_pivot['users'] = array('User_model','id','id'); where the second parameter is the foreign primary key of users table, and the third parameter is the local primary key.
	}
}
```

####Get relation data on many to many relationship

You get data only related key ids on many to many relationships. If you set as TRUE 4th parameter, you will get related data not only keys.

For this you only have to add another key named 'get_relate' and set it to true:

```php
class Posts_Model extends MY_Model 
{
    public $table = 'posts';
    public has_many_pivot['posts'] = array(
           		    'foreign_model'=>'Post_model',
           		    'pivot_table'=>'posts_users',
           		    'local_key'=>'id',
           		    'pivot_local_key'=>'user_id', /* this is the related key in the pivot table to the local key
           		        this is an optional key, but if your column name inside the pivot table
           		        doesn't respect the format of "singularlocaltable_primarykey", then you must set it. In the next title
           		        you will see how a pivot table should be set, if you want to  skip these keys */
           		    'pivot_foreign_key'=>'post_id', /* this is also optional, the same as above, but for foreign table's keys */
           		    'foreign_key'=>'id',
           		    'get_relate'=>FALSE /* another optional setting, which is explained below */
           		);
}
```

##Working with relationships

Every table has a way to interact with other tables. So if your model has relationships with other models, you can define those relationships:
```php
class User_model extends MY_Model
{

    function __construct()
    {
        $this->has_one['phone'] = 'Phone_model';
        $this->has_one['address'] = array('Address_model','user_id','id');
        $this->has_many['posts'] = 'Post_model';
        parent::__construct();
    }
}
```
You can then access your related data using the `with_*()` method:
```php
$user = $this->user_model->with_phone()->with_posts()->get(1);
```
The `with_*()` method can accept parameters like 'fields', 'where', and 'non_exclusive_where'.

With the `fields:...` you can enumerate the fields you want returned.
```php
$user = $this->user_model->with_phone('fields:mobile_number')->get(1);
```

Also you can count the sub-results by using `fields:*count*`.
```php
$users_with_number_posts = $this->user_model->with_posts('fields:*count*')->get_all();
```
Take note that you can retrieve the count as `counted_rows` (do a print_r() and you'll understand what I mean).

With the `where:...` you can pass a where clause that will be interpreted as string.

The where clause is an *exclusivist* one. That means that it will retrieve only results that are complying to the subresult's where. If a `users` table has relationship with a `details` table, and you set a `where` clause inside the with_*() method, that `where:...` looks only for the results that have `first_name` of `John` in the `details` table, the final results that will be returned will only be those users from the `users` table that have a related first_name inside the `details` table of `John`.
```php
$user = $this->user_model->with_phone('fields:mobile_number', 'where:`phone_status`=\'active\'')->get(1);
```

A `non_exclusive_where` would return all the main results and only the additional subresults appended to the main results.

*NB: You won't be able to add an exclusive and a non-exclusive where in the same time*

The related data will be embedded in the returned value having "phone", and "posts" as keys.
```php
echo $user->phone->phone_number;

foreach ($user->posts as $post)
{
    echo $post->title;
}
```

###Order the results of the relastionship results

Sometimes you need to order the results coming from the with_*() method. In order do this, you can use the order_inside parameter like below:

```php
$this->author_model->with_posts('fields:...|order_inside:published_at desc')->get_all();
```
A query like the one above should return all the authors with their respective posts ordered by the publish date. You can also have more than one order inside parameters:

```php
$this->author_model->with_posts('fields:...|order_inside:published_at desc, readings asc')->get_all();
```

###Order THE MAIN RESULT by the relationship data

You can order the main result by using a field that can be found inside a relationship column.
```php
$this->post_model->with_author("order_by:username,asc")->get_all();
```
The code above will order all the posts by the username of the authors (ascending).

###Retrieve data from nested relationships (or should we say retrieve nested relationships data?)

In order to retrieve data from nested relationships, we should pass the with_*() method a multidimensional array. Let's assume we have a Country_model with many City_model, the City_Model having many Company_model:

So... the Country_model.php: would look like this:

```php
class Country_model extends MY_Model
{
    function __construct()
    {
        $this->has_many['cities'] = array('foreign_model'=>'City_model','foreign_table'=>'cities','foreign_key'=>'country_id','local_key'=>'id');
    }
}
```

The City_model.php would look like this:

```php
class City_model extends MY_Model
{
    function __construct()
    {
        $this->has_one['country'] = array('foreign_model'=>'Country_model','foreign_table'=>'countries','foreign_key'=>'id','local_key'=>'country_id');
        $this->has_many['companies'] = array('foreign_model'=>'Company_model','foreign_table'=>'companies','foreign_key'=>'city_id','local_key'=>'id');
    }
}
```

The Company_model.php would look like this:

```php
class Company_model extends MY_Model
{
    function __construct()
    {
        $this->has_one['city'] = array('foreign_model'=>'City_model','foreign_table'=>'cities','foreign_key'=>'id','local_key'=>'city_id');
    }
}
```

Now, if we want to retrieve the cities with their companies from a country we would go like this:

```php
$this->country_model->with_cities(array('fields'=>'name,id,population','with'=>array('relation'=>'companies','fields'=>'name,phone_number'))->get($country_id);
```

##Database Connection

The class will automatically use the default database connection, and even load it for you if you haven't yet.

You can specify a database connection on a per-model basis by declaring the `$_database_connection` instance variable.

You can also change the database connection on a per request basis. For example, if you want to use a different database connection for writing data you can do this:
```php
$this->user_model->on('write_conn')->delete(3);
```
After this, I would advise you to do a `$this->user_model->reset_connection();` in order to reset the database connection to the model's (or application's) default.

##Observers##

There are times when you'll need to alter your model data before or after it's inserted or returned. This could be adding timestamps, pulling in relationships or deleting dependent rows. The MVC pattern states that these sorts of operations need to go in the model. In order to facilitate this, MY_Model contains a series of callbacks/observers -- methods that will be called at certain points.

The full list of observers are as follows:
```php
$before_create = array();
$after_create = array();
$before_update = array();
$after_update = array();
$before_get = array();
$after_get = array();
$before_delete = array();
$after_delete = array();
$before_soft_delete = array();
$after_soft_delete = array();
```
These are instance variables usually defined at the class level. They are arrays of methods on this class to be called at certain points. An example:
```php
class User_model extends MY_Model
{
	function __construct()
	{
		$this->before_create[] = 'hash_password';
		parent::__construct();
	}

	protected function hash_password($data)
    	{
        	$data['password'] = 'whateverpasswordcreationresultyoumaythinkof';
        	return $data;
    	}
}
```
Each observer overwrites its predecessor's data, sequentially, in the order the observers are defined. In order to work with relationships, the MY_Model already has an `after_get` trigger which will be called last.

##Available methods

###insert($data)
It inserts one or more rows into table

####Parameters
* $data - data to be inserted.

####Return
* either a integer representing the id of the inserted row;
* or an array with ids.

####Examples
```php
$data = array('username'=>'avenirer','email'=>'avenir.ro@gmail.com');
$this->user_model->insert($data);
```

###update($data, $column_name_where = NULL)
It updates one or more rows from table

####Parameters
* $data - the updated data as object or multidimensional array or multiple array (just like the native $this->db->update())
* $column_name_where - no value if you want to update all rows, an id of the row, an array containing column name and value or, if there are multiple rows, the name of the column that can be found in the $data array.

####Return
Returns the number of affected rows

####Examples
```php
$newdata = array('status'=>'1');
$this->user_model->update($data);

$newdata = array('username'=>'aveniro');
$this->user_model->update($data,1);

$newdata = array('username'=>'aveniro', 'email'=>'avenir.ro@gmail.ro');
$this->user_model->update($data,array('email'=>'avenir.ro@gmail.com'));

$newdata = array('username'=>'aveniro', 'email'=>'avenir.ro@gmail.com');
$this->user_model->update($data,'email');
```

###where($field_or_array = NULL, $operator_or_value = NULL, $value = NULL, $with_or = FALSE, $with_not = FALSE, $custom_string = FALSE)
It sets a where condition to the query

####Parameters
* $field_or_array, $operator_or_value = NULL - if you want to look by an id you can simply pass the id; if you want to look for a value of a column, you can pass it as to parameters where('column','value');  if you have multiple columns for identifing a row you can pass it an array where(array('column1'=>'value1','column2'=>'value2')); if you have a "where in" type of query (multiple posible values for a column), you can pass it the name of the column as first parameter and an array of possible values as second parameter;

####Return
Doesn't return anything, being a part of the query chain

####Examples
```php
$this->user_model->where(3)->get();
//you can also do it like this: $this->user_model->get(3);

$this->user_model->where('username','avenirer')->get();

$this->user_model->where('id >=', '3')->get();

$this->user_model->where(array('email'=>'avenir.ro@gmail.com','username'=>'avenirer'))->get();

$this->user_model->where('username',array('avenirer','aveniro')->get();
```

###where_*()
Although I wouldn't advise (there are some buggy things there...), there is also a "dynamic" where. That means that at any time you can write a where method that contains the name of the column:

```php
$this->user_model->where_username('avenirer')->get(); // where the "username" value is avenirer
$this->user->model->where_mail(array('avenir.ro@gmail.com','adrian.voicu@avenir.ro'))->get_all();
```

###limit($limit,$offset=0)
Is a self explaining method...

###order_by($criteria, $order = 'ASC')
Is a wrapper for $this->db->order_by()

###group_by($grouping_by)
Is a wrapper for $this->db->group_by()

###delete(where)
It deletes or soft deletes (depending on your settings) rows, working like the native $this->db->delete().

####Parameters

####Return
It returns affected rows or false, if no delete was done.

###force_delete(where)
It forces the delete of row(s) if soft delete was enabled. Takes same parameters and returns same thing like the method before

###restore($where)
Restores row(s) that were previously soft deleted.
Takes same parameters and returns same thing like the method before

###trashed($where)
Verifies if a row is soft deleted or not

####Return
It returns TRUE or FALSE

####Examples
```php
if($this->user_model->trashed(1))
{
	echo 'the user was deleted';
}
```

###get($where = NULL)
Returns a single row that respects the $where parameter

####Parameters
* where - the $where parameter uses the where($param) method, that means only one parameter

####Return
Returns a row;

####Examples
```php
$user = $this->user_model->get(1);

$user = $this->user_model->get(array('username'=>'avenirer'));
```

###get_all($where = NULL)
Same as the get() method but it can return more than one row

###paginate($rows_per_page = 10, $total_rows = NULL, $page_number = 1)

####Parameters
* rows_per_page = 10 - the number of rows per page
* total_rows = NULL - the total number of rows
* page_number = 1 - current page number

####Return
Returns the results and created the links that can be retrieved by accessing "previous_page", "next_page" and "all_pages" properties

###count_rows($where)
Returns the number of rows.

####Example
```php
$users = $this->user_model->as_array()->count_rows();
```

###as_array()
Sets the option to return the results as an array(), if the model was previously set to return the results as objects.

####Example
```php
$users = $this->user_model->as_array()->get_all();
```

###fields($fields)
Allows the user to select only specific columns

###Examples
```php
$users = $this->user_model->fields('username,password')->get_all();

$users = $this->user_model->fields(array('users.username', 'users.password', 'group.name')->get_all();
```

###as_object()
Sets the option to return the results as object, if the model was previously set to return the results as arrays.

####Example
```php
$users = $this->user_model->as_object()->get_all();
```

###with_trashed()
Sets the option to return in the results the rows that were soft deleted

####Example
```php
$users = $this->user_model->with_trashed()->get_all;
```

###only_trashed()
Sets the option to return in the results only the rows that were soft deleted

####Example
```php
$users = $this->user_model->only_trashed()->get_all;
```

###on($connection_group)
Sets a connection group for the current chain query

###reset_connection()
Resets the connection to the database to the one that is set for the model or the default connection
